An emulator for m68k CPUs and devices.  I originally started this project to
distract myself while recovering from a bout of sickness.  The idea was to
emulate the computer I had built as part of the
[computie project](https://github.com/transistorfet/computie).

Currently it can run the monitor program and load the kernel across serial
(or the kernel can be loaded directly into memory), and it can boot the kernel,
but an error occurs as soon as the kernel runs.  It doesn't yet have interrupt
support, but that will be the next thing added.
