* can you eventually make the system connections all configurable via a config file?
* test using mpsc to pass messages with the tty IO thread, and test if it's slower than what you have now

* make it possible to break out of the current execution, into the debugger, by using a certain keystroke

* make tests for each instruction

* unimplemented: ABCD, ADDX, BFFFO, BFINS, BKPT, CHK, EXG, ILLEGAL, MOVEfromCCR, MOVEP, RTR, RTD, SBCD, SUBX
* undecoded: ADDX, SUBX
* modify execution for >=MC68020: MOVEM
* >=MC68020 undecoded & unimplemented: CALLM, CAS, CAS2, CHK2, CMP2, RTM, PACK, TRAPcc, UNPK

* add support for MMU
* add support for FPU
* Coprocessor instructions: cpBcc, cpDBcc, cpGEN, cpScc, cpTRAPcc


* should you simulate clock ticks, and only step devices when they next request it
* how can you have multple CPUs
* should you simulate bus arbitration?


* check all instructions in the docs
