* how will you add the cpu, which is not addressable, but is steppable, and also interruptable... what else?
* should you simulate bus arbitration?
* if the bus had an Rc<RefCell<Box<dyn AddressableDevice>>>, then it could be like AddressSpace used to be, with it's own Addressable, and then you could
  access one of multiple busses to do an op on it, rather than a single bus per machine
* can you get rid of the duplicate read/write functions in System?

* how do you pass in a mutable system to a mutable device?  At the very least, I need the AddressSpace, but that needs access to the devices/memory segments.
  I could make System contain refcells for submutability



* check all instructions in the docs

* make tests for each instruction
